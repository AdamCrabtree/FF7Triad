##Introduction

This is a project to recreate Final Fantasy 7 Triple Triad in C# with WPF. 

##Game 

This game has a deck of cards for each player. Each player selects 5 cards and then plays them on a 3x3 board. Each card has an attack value top, bottom, left, and right. If a card is placed next to an enemy card that has a lower value then that card will flip. There are alternative game modes not currently implemented. 

##Disclaimer

A lot of this code is holdover code until I get the board logic to work. Once I get the board logic to work I'll be redoing how cards are created and handled. Until then a lot of this is poor placeholder code.
